In order to start developing for the project, clone the repository.
Build the front-end with `npm install` and then `ng build` from simplepools-website-frontend.
In order to work on the frontend use `./start-with-proxy.bat` (on windows) to start watching for changes
and in another terminal run the server with: `mvnw spring-boot:run` from simplepools-webapp.
If you want to debug the Java server you can start with debug `org.simplepools.webapp.WebappApplication`.
