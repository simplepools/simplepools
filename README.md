How to start developing:
Clone the repository. Build the front-end with `npm install` and then `ng build` from `simplepools-website-frontend` folder.
For frontend development use `./start-with-proxy.bat` (on windows) to start watching for changes and proxy server requests to the spring-boot app.
In another terminal run the server with: `mvnw spring-boot:run` from `simplepools-webapp` folder.
If you want to debug the Java server you can start with debug `org.simplepools.webapp.WebappApplication`.
